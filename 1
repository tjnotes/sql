Problem 1: Print All Even Numbers from 1 to 20Description: Write a for loop that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is even.Example Output: 2, 4, 6, ... , 20Problem 2: Sum of the First 10 Natural NumbersDescription: Use a while loop to calculate and print the sum of the first 10 natural numbers (1 to 10).Hint: Keep adding numbers to a variable initialized to 0.Example Output: Sum = 55Problem 3: Reverse a ListDescription: Given a list, use a for loop to print its elements in reverse order.Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]Example Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1Hint: Iterate over the list in reverse using range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1).Problem 4: Count the Number of Elements in a List Greater Than a Given NumberDescription: Write a while loop to count how many elements in a list are greater than a specific value.Input: arr = [3, 8, 1, 6, 10, 2], n = 5Example Output: 3 elements are greater than 5Hint: Use a counter to keep track of the number of elements meeting the condition.Problem 5: Create a Multiplication TableDescription: Use a for loop to generate and print the multiplication table for a given number up to 10.Input: n = 7Example Output:7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
...
7 x 10 = 70
