## Honestly? **Maybe** - Here's Why:

## Potential Issues:

**1. Jaeger Version Dependency**
- Older Jaeger versions may not support these TLS flags
- Flag names might be different in your version
- Some versions need different syntax

**2. Certificate Format Issues**
- Windows certificate conversion can be tricky
- PEM format must be exactly right
- File permissions might cause problems

**3. NSSM Service Context**
- Service might not have access to certificate files
- File paths might need to be absolute
- Service account permissions

## Success Probability: **60-70%**

## What Could Go Wrong:
- Service fails to start (check logs)
- Certificates not recognized
- Wrong TLS flag names for your Jaeger version

## My Recommendation:
**Try it, but have backup plan ready.**

If it doesn't work after 15-20 minutes of troubleshooting, **switch to nginx reverse proxy** - that approach has 95% success rate because:
- Nginx handles TLS perfectly
- No dependency on Jaeger version
- Standard, well-documented approach

## Next Steps:
1. Try the TLS configuration
2. If service starts successfully → test your app
3. If it fails → check logs and we'll debug
4. If too many issues → switch to nginx

**Want to proceed with this approach?** We can always pivot if needed.
